Stereo class D power amplifier module

This code was developed to run on the iPod dock, but provides an example of how
to implement a class D PA.

Audio samples are accepted at 48.0, 44.1 or 32.0 kHz.
These samples are interpolated up to a frequency at 8 times the original sample rate.
The interpolated samples are output for left and right channels to drive the classD 
output stage via PWM.
